Objective

In this challenge, we use a Regular Expression to evaluate a string. Check out the attached tutorial for more details.

Task

Complete the function in the editor below by returning a RegExp object,re , that matches any string s that begins and ends with the same vowel. Recall that the English vowels are a, e, i, o, and u.

//javascriptcode

function regexVar() {
    /*
     * Declare a RegExp object variable named 're'
     * It must match a string that starts and ends with the same vowel (i.e., {a, e, i, o, u})
     */
    
    var re = RegExp(/^([aeiou]).*\1$/);
    /*
     * Do not remove the return statement
     */
    return re;
}
