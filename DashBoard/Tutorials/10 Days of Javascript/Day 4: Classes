Objective

In this challenge, we practice using JavaScript classes. Check the attached tutorial for more details.

Task

Create a Polygon class that has the following properties:

A constructor that takes an array of integer values describing the lengths of the polygon's sides.
A perimeter() method that returns the polygon's perimeter.
Locked code in the editor tests the Polygon constructor and the perimeter method.

Note: The perimeter method must be lowercase and spelled correctly.

//javascriptcode

class Polygon {
    constructor(heights) 
    {
        var polygon_perimeter = 0;
        for (var index in heights)
            {
                polygon_perimeter += heights[index];
            }
        
        this.my_perimeter = polygon_perimeter;
    }
    
     perimeter() 
    {
        return this.my_perimeter;
    }
    
}
