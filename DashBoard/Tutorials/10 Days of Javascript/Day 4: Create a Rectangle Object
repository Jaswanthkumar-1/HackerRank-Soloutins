Objective

In this challenge, we practice creating objects. Check out the attached tutorial for more details.

Task

Complete the function in the editor. It has two parameters:  and . It must return an object modeling a rectangle that has the following properties:

lenght : This value is equal to a.
width : This value is equal to b.
perimeter: This value is equal to 2.(a+b).
area : This value is equal to a.b.
Note: The names of the object's properties must be spelled correctly to pass this challenge.

//javascriptcode

function Rectangle(a, b) {
    this.length = a;
    this.width = b;
    this.perimeter = 2 * (a+b);
    this.area = a * b;
}
