Objective

Today, we're practicing bitwise operations. Check the attached tutorial for more details.

Task

We define s to be a sequence of distinct sequential integers from 1 ton ; in other words, . We want to know the maximum bitwise AND value of any two integers,  and  (where ), in sequence  that is also less than a given integer,k .

Complete the function in the editor so that given  and , it returns the maximum .

Note: The  symbol represents the bitwise AND operator.

//javascriptcode

function getMaxLessThanK(n, k) {
    let maximum = 0;
    let current = -1;
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) 
    {
        for (let j = i + 1; j <= n; j++) 
        {
            current = i & j;
            if (current < k && current > maximum) 
            {
                maximum = current;
            }
        }
    }
    return maximum;
}
