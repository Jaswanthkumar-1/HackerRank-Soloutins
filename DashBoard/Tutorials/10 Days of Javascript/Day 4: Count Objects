Objective

In this challenge, we learn about iterating over objects. Check the attached tutorial for more details.

Task
Complete the function in the editor. It has one parameter: an array,a , of objects. Each object in the array has two integer properties denoted by x and y. The function must return a count of all such objects o in array a that satisfy o.x == o.y.

//javascriptcode

function getCount(objects) {
    var count = 0;
    for (var index in objects)
        {
            if (objects[index].x == objects[index].y)
                {
                    count++;
                }
        }
    return count;
}
