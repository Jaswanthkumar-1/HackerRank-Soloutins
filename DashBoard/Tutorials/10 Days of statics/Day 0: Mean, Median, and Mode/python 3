Given an array,x,n of  integers, calculate and print the respective mean, median, and mode on separate lines. If your array contains more than one modal value, choose the numerically smallest one.
Note: Other than the modal value (which will always be an integer), your answers should be in decimal form, rounded to a scale of 1 decimal place (i.e.,12.3,7.0 format).

import numpy as np
from scipy import stats

size = int(input())
numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))
print(np.mean(numbers))
print(np.median(numbers))
print(int(stats.mode(numbers)[0]))
