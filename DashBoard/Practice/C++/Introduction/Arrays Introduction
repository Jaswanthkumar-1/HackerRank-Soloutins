An array is a series of elements of the same type placed in contiguous memory locations that can be individually referenced by adding an index to a unique identifier.

For arrays of a known size, 10 in this case, use the following declaration:

int arr[10]; //Declares an array named arr of size 10, i.e, you can 
store 10 integers.
Note Unlike C, C++ allows dynamic allocation of arrays at runtime without special calls like malloc(). If n=10, int arr[n] will create an array with space for 10 integers.

Accessing elements of an array:

Indexing in arrays starts from 0.So the first element is stored at 
arr[0],the second element at arr[1] and so on through arr[9].
You will be given an array of N integers and you have to print the integers in the reverse order.

    for(int i=0;i<N;i++){
        cin>> a[i];         }
    for(int j=N-1;j>=0;j--){
        cout<< a[j] <<" ";  }
    return 0;
}
