Double ended queue or Deque(part of C++ STL) are sequence containers with dynamic sizes that can be expanded or contracted on both ends (either its front or its back). The member functions of deque that are mainly used are:

Deque Template:

std::deque<value_type>
Declaration:

deque<int> mydeque; //Creates a double ended queue of deque of int type
Size

int length = mydeque.size(); //Gives the size of the deque
Push

mydeque.push_back(1); //Pushes element at the end
mydeque.push_front(2); //Pushes element at the beginning
Pop

mydeque.pop_back(); //Pops element from the end
mydeque.pop_front(); //Pops element from the beginning
Empty

mydeque.empty() //Returns a boolean value which tells whether the deque is empty or not

Given a set of arrays of size  and an integer , you have to find the maximum integer for each and every contiguous subarray of size  for each of the given arrays.

//c++ language

void printKMax(int arr[], int n, int k){
    std::deque<int>  Qi;
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        while ( (!Qi.empty()) && arr[i] >= arr[Qi.back()])
            Qi.pop_back();

        Qi.push_back(i);
    }

    for ( ; i < n; ++i) {
        cout << arr[Qi.front()] << " ";

        while ( (!Qi.empty()) && Qi.front() <= i - k)
            Qi.pop_front();

        while ( (!Qi.empty()) && arr[i] >= arr[Qi.back()])
            Qi.pop_back();

        Qi.push_back(i);
    }

    cout << arr[Qi.front()] << "\n";
}
