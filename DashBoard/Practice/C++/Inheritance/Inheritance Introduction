One of the important topics of Object Oriented Programming is Inheritance. Inheritance allows us to define a class in terms of another class, which allows us in the reusability of the code.Check out the code below:

//c++ language

class Isosceles:public Triangle
{
public:
    void isosceles()
        {
        cout<<"I am an isosceles triangle\n";
        }
       void description()
        {
        cout<<"In an isosceles triangle two sides are equal\n";
        }
};
