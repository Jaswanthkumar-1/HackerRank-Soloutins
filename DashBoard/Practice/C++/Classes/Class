Classes in C++ are user defined types declared with keyword class that has data and functions . 
Although classes and structures have the same type of functionality, there are some basic differences.
The data members of a class are private by default and the members of a structure are public by default. Along with storing multiple data in a common block, it also assigns some functions (known as methods) to manipulate/access them.
It serves as the building block of Object Oriented Programming.

//c++ language

class Student {
    private:
        int age;
        string first_name;
        string last_name;
        int standard;
    public:
        void set_age(int a) {
            age = a;
        }
        int get_age() {
            return age;
        }

        void set_first_name(string fn) {
            first_name = fn;
        }
        string get_first_name() {
            return first_name;
        }

        void set_last_name(string ln) {
            last_name = ln;
        }
        string get_last_name() {
            return last_name;
        }

        void set_standard(int s) {
            standard = s;
        }
        int get_standard() {
            return standard;
        }

        string to_string() {
            stringstream ss;
            ss << age << "," << first_name << "," << last_name << "," << standard;
            return ss.str();
        }
};
