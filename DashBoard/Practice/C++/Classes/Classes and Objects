A class defines a blueprint for an object. We use the same syntax to declare objects of a class as we use to declare variables of other basic types. For example:

Box box1;          // Declares variable box1 of type Box
Box box2;          // Declare variable box2 of type Box
Kristen is a contender for valedictorian of her high school. She wants to know how many students (if any) have scored higher than her in the  exams given during this semester.

Create a class named  with the following specifications:

//c++ language

// Write your Student class here
class Student {
    private:
    int scores[5];
    public:
    void input() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            cin >> scores[i];
        }
    }
    int calculateTotalScore() {
        int counter = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            counter += scores[i];
        }
        return counter;
    }
};
