In this challenge, you are required to handle error messages while working with small computational server that performs complex calculations.
It has a function that takes  large numbers as its input and returns a numeric result. Unfortunately, there are various exceptions that may occur during execution.

Complete the code in your editor so that it prints appropriate error messages, should anything go wrong. The expected behavior is defined as follows:

If the compute function runs fine with the given arguments, then print the result of the function call.
If it fails to allocate the memory that it needs, print Not enough memory.
If any other standard C++ exception occurs, print Exception: S where  is the exception's error message.
If any non-standard exception occurs, print Other Exception.

//c++ language

/* Enter your code here. */
        try {
          cout << Server::compute(A, B) << "\n";
        } catch (const std::bad_alloc& e) {
            cout << "Not enough memory\n";
        } catch (const std::exception& e) {
            cout << "Exception: " << e.what() << "\n";
        } catch (...) {
            cout << "Other Exception\n";
        }
