A class template provides a specification for generating classes based on parameters. Class templates are generally used to implement containers. A class template is instantiated by passing a given set of types to it as template arguments. Here is an example of a class, MyTemplate, that can store one element of any type and that has just one member function divideBy2, which divides its value by 2.

//c++ language

#define cin ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);cin.tie(NULL); cin
#define concatenate add

/*Write the class AddElements here*/
template<typename T>
class AddElements{
    private:
    T element;
    public:
    AddElements(T element){  
        this->element = element;
    }
    T add(T a){ return element + a;
}
