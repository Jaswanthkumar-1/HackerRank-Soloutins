Amber's conglomerate corporation just acquired some new companies. Each of the companies follows this hierarchy: 
Given the table schemas below, write a query to print the company_code, founder name, total number of lead managers, total number of senior managers, total number of managers, and total number of employees. Order your output by ascending company_code.
Note:
The tables may contain duplicate records.
The company_code is string, so the sorting should not be numeric. For example, if the company_codes are C_1, C_2, and C_10, then the ascending company_codes will be C_1, C_10, and C_2.

//Oracle Language

SELECT employee.company_code,company.founder,
COUNT(DISTINCT employee.lead_manager_code), COUNT(DISTINCT employee.senior_manager_code), 
COUNT(DISTINCT employee.manager_code), COUNT(DISTINCT employee.employee_code) 
FROM employee employee INNER JOIN company company 
ON employee.company_code = company.company_code 
GROUP BY employee.company_code,company.founder 
ORDER BY employee.company_code;
